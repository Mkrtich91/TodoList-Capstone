# To-do List Application

In this project, you must design and develop a web application according to the requirements that are specified in the task description.
  * The application you have to develop must contain two web components - a web and a web API applications.
  * The web application is a [ASP.NET Core MVC application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview).
  * The web API application is a [controller-based ASP.NET Core Web API application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/apis).
  * The data store must be a relational database management system such as SQL Server Express.
  * To access application data the application must use [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/).
  * The application must use the [ASP.NET Core Identity API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity) to manage users, passwords and profile data.


## Backlog

The application functional requirements are described in the [Functional Requirements](functional-requirements.md) document.

The [backlog with the user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_backlog) you need to implement is given in the table below. The full list of user stories with descriptions is in the [User Stories](user-stories.md) document.

Here are some hints for you:
* Follow the priority order. Start working on user stories in the order listed in the "Priority" column.
* Mark stories as completed in the [README.md](README.md) file. Once you've finished developing a user story, mark it as completed in the "Is completed?" column (use the "+" or any other text). This mark will help the mentor who will review your project understand which functionality is implemented and which is not.
* Focus on quality. Implement as many user stories as possible, but if you see that you do not have enough time to complete lower-priority user stories, polish the user stories you have already completed.
